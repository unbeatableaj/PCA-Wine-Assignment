# PCA-Wine-Assignment
# Introduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used in unsupervised machine learning to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most of the information in the original data. In this project, we will be performing PCA on the wine.csv dataset to identify the most important features that contribute to the quality of wine.

# Data Description
The wine.csv dataset contains 178 rows and 14 columns. The columns include various features of the wine, such as alcohol content, malic acid, ash, and more.

# Methodology
We will be using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the wine.csv dataset while retaining most of the information in the original data. PCA works by finding the directions in the data that have the largest variance, and then projecting the data onto those directions.

We will first preprocess the data by scaling the features to ensure that they have the same scale. Then we will perform PCA on the data and determine the number of principal components to retain using the scree plot and cumulative explained variance. Finally, we will interpret the principal components to identify the most important features that contribute to the quality of wine.

# Results
Our analysis showed that the optimal number of principal components to retain for this dataset is 3. The scree plot and cumulative explained variance showed that these two principal components capture most of the information in the original data. We interpreted the principal components and found that the most important features that contribute to the quality of wine are alcohol content, total phenols, and flavanoids.

# Conclusion
PCA is a powerful technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most of the information in the original data. In this project, we used PCA to identify the most important features that contribute to the quality of wine. Our analysis showed that the optimal number of principal components to retain for this dataset is 3, and that the most important features are alcohol content, total phenols, and flavanoids.

This information can be used by winemakers to better understand the factors that contribute to the quality of wine, and to develop targeted strategies for improving the quality of their products. Further analysis can be done on the relationships between these features and the quality of wine, to develop a more complete understanding of the factors that contribute to wine quality.
